# Launch Jupyter from the Environment
  jupyter notebook

ðŸ”¹ Add the virtual environment to jupyter after activating the venv in cmd
To use your virtual env (myenv*) as a Jupyter kernel:

  pip install ipykernel

ðŸ§  1. Add venv to Jupyter kernel after acvitivation
You need to activate the virtual environment in CMD first. Just run the command using its Python path:

âœ… CMD:
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv* --display-name "My Project (myenv)"

Then itâ€™ll show up as a selectable kernel in Jupyter.

ðŸ§  2. Add venv to Jupyter kernel WITHOUT activating
You don't need to activate the virtual environment. Just run the command using its Python path:

âœ… CMD:
  myenv\Scripts\python.exe -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv* --display-name "My Project (myenv)"

This registers the venv as a selectable kernel, even if it's not currently activated.
